<!-- AWS Cloud Support Plans -->
AWS offers four different support plans.

Basic

Basic is the default support option.

Basic support is free.

<!-- Paid Support -->
You need to pay to access a higher level of support than basic.

The alternatives are:

Developer: lowest cost
Business: cost in the middle
