<!-- Cloud Pricing Models - AWS -->
AWS has many different pay-as-you-go pricing options.

<!-- Pay for What You Use -->
Pay only for the resources that you use.

No need for long-term contracts.

No need for licensing agreements.

<!-- Pay Less When You Reserve -->
Requires a commitment for future consumption.

You need to pay no matter if you use the services or not.

Reserve resources will give you a discount.

This option is for those who know that they need the resources in the future.
<!-- Pay Less with Volume-Based Discount When You Use More -->
The service gets cheaper the more you use.

Pricing per unit gets lower when you cross a threshold.

More use, pay less.

<!-- AWS Pricing Calculator -->
The Pricing Calculator lets you create a cost estimate for the use of AWS resources.

Organize the estimates into groups.

Use the groups to simulate how your business is organized. For example, by cost centers.

The estimates can be shared with others by links.
