<!-- Introduction to Availability Zones -->
Availability Zone is a single Data Center or a group of Data Centers in a region.

In an Availability Zone the Data Centers are located many miles apart from each other.

Having them apart reduces the risk of them all going down if a disaster happens in the region.

Simultaneously, have the Data Center(s) close enough to have low latency.
Three regions (orange circles): N. California, Oregon, GovCloud(US-West).

The regions have availability zones (blue circles) displayed as a grid around them.

The picture zooms in on the N. California region.

N. California has an availability zone of three groupings of Data Centers: US-West-1A, US-West-1B, and US-West-1C.
