AWS offers two managed tools: AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS CloudFormation.
<!-- AWS Elastic Beanstalk -->
With AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you provide code and configuration settings.

Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:

Adjust capacity
Load balancing
Automatic scaling
Application health monitoring
<!-- AWS CloudFormation -->
With AWS CloudFormation, you can treat your infrastructure as code.

Using this service you can build an environment by writing lines of code.

Instead of using the AWS Management Console to provision resources individually.
