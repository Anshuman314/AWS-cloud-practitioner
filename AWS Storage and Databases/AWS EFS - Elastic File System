Cloud File System - AWS EFS
AWS EFS is also called AWS Elastic File System.

EFS is a file system.

Data in EFS is accessed via file paths.

Compared to AWS EBS, AWS EFS saves the data in many Availability Zones.

Scaling AWS EFS does not disrupt applications.

It is ideal if many services need to access the same data at the same time.
