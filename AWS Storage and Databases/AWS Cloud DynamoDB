<!-- Non-relational Cloud Database - AWS DynamoDB -->
AWS DynamoDB is a non-relational, NoSQL database.

It is a serverless database.

DynamoDB is a high performance service.

As AWS DynamoDB is a serverless database, you do not have to manage servers or an operational system to use it.
<!-- What is a Non-Relational Database? -->
One of the structure types of the non-relational database is key-value pairs.

Data key represents an item, and data value represents that item attributes.

Each item can have different attributes.

You can remove any attribute from any item at any time.

Example of non-relational database data:

ID	Data
Name: Katherine Smith
1	Profession: Photographer
Race: White
Name: Joe Doe
2	Age: 35
Height: 190cm
