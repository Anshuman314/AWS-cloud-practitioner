<!-- AWS EC2 Auto Scaling -->
Servers can get more requests than they can handle.

Too many requests can cause timeouts and outages.

AWS EC2 Auto Scaling allows you to add or remove EC2 instances automatically.

It automates the capacity to the demand.

There are two approaches:

Dynamic scaling: responds to changing demand
Predictive scaling: schedules the number of instances based on a predicted demand
Dynamic and Predictive scaling can be combined to scale faster

<!-- AWS EC2 Auto Scaling -->
EC2 Auto Scaling can be added as a buffer on top of your instances.

It can add new instances to the application when necessary and terminate them when no longer needed.

You can set up a group of instances.

Here you can set a minimum capacity of instances that will always be running. The rest will operate when necessary.

You can set the desired number of AWS EC2 instances in the scaling group.

However, the desired capacity defaults to your minimum capacity if not specified.

The last configuration is Maximum capacity.

Here you set the maximum capacity of instances to be used.
The Auto Scaling groups allow you to have a dynamic environment.

You set the minimum capacity, the desired number, and the maximum capacity.

The group will operate within the config and give you a predictable and cost-effective architecture.
