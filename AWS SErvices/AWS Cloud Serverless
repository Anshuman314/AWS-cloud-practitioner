Serverless is a service where you do not have to think about servers.

With serverless, you only have to think about code.

The cloud provider handles all infrastructure behind it.

<!-- To run EC2, you must do the following: -->

Provision of the virtual server instances
Deploy your code
Operate and maintain the servers
