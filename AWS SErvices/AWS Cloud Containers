<!-- Containers in the AWS Cloud -->
Containers are popular for deploying and managing applications in the cloud.

Containers let you package code in a single object.

The container isolates the code and removes the dependencies to other components.

It runs in isolation.

Containers are an essential concept in micro service architectures.
<!-- Containerized Approach -->
Having the application in a container makes debugging easier.

It makes it easier because the application is inside of an isolated container.

The container remains consistent regardless of deployment.
<!-- Containers and Scale -->
Container orchestration services help you deploy, manage, and scale your containerized applications.

In the following chapters, you will learn about two services that provide container orchestration: AWS Elastic Container Service and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service.
