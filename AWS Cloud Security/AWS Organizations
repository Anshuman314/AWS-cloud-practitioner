<!-- What is AWS Organization? -->
AWS Organizations is a container for your AWS accounts.

It comes with an organization root user by default.

It allows you to manage permissions of your organization's accounts.

Permissions in AWS organizations are controlled by service control policies (SCPs).

SCPs allow you to restrict AWS resources and services for each account.
<!-- What Are Organizational Units -->
Organizational units (OUs) are groups of accounts in the AWS organization.

OUs are used to manage accounts with the same or similar permissions more easily.

The permission policy of OU is applied to all OU accounts.
