<!-- Denial-of-Service Attacks -->
Denial-of-service attacks (DoS) attack is an effort to make an application or a website inaccessible.

The DoS causes an excessive flood of data that overloads an application or a website network.

DoS attack comes from a single source.

<!-- Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks -->
Distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) attack comes from different sources.

Like DoS, DDoS attempts to make an application or a website inaccessible.

The attack can come from more than one attacker or a single attacker that uses bots.

Bots are infected computers that automatically flood your application or a website with excessive traffic.
